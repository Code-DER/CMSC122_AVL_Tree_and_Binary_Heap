# CMSC122_AVL_Tree_and_Binary_Heap
This repository is for a laboratory exercise for CMSC 122

In this activity, we will implement an AVL Tree and a Binary Heap in Python.

## AVL Tree Features
- Insertion of nodes
- Deletion of nodes
- Traversal methods

## Binary Heap Features
- Insertion
- Root extraction
